# 404 - Domain parking

I recently bought some domains I have no use for. Maybe I will use them in some future projects, but I just don't know yet.  
Fot the time being, these domains will **all** redirect to [parking.janetschel.dev](https://parking.janetschel.dev) and a 404 page will be displayed.

This project was written in Svelte, a frontend-"framework" for JavaScript, since I wanted to try it out for some time now.

There is nothing really interesting to see on the 404-page except for for some redirects to my homepage.
